Hey there,
I run the organization behind @paypaldev 
Just saw your [tweet](https://twitter.com/iAmNewYorkNick/status/932986690800685056) about our docs.  We're actually in the process of revamping our documentation, and we're going to start running beta usability tests soon.

Would you like to participate?  (Sorry about the stealth contact.  We're trying to keep the redesign low key :) )
You can reach me -> lmarkus [at] paypal.com
